# NHUG Monthly Meetings

NHUG holds monthly meetings featuring different HPC-related topics, __on the third Tuesday of the month, from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. Mountain Time__. Our goal is to build a vibrant community around HPC-related issues and to increase collaboration within the NCAR HPC user community. These meetings provide a venue for discussion, coordination, and showcasing NCAR HPC-related work in progress. 

All NCAR HPC users, regardless of experience or sophistication, are welcome and encouraged to attend. 

What to Expect at NHUG Meetings:

* **Spotlight on Workshops and Training:** We kick off every meeting by highlighting upcoming workshops and training events, ensuring you stay informed about valuable learning opportunities.

* **NCAR HPC Updates:** We provide updates on the latest NCAR HPC news and events, including system updates, maintenance, and other important information.

* **Featured Projects:** We invite members of the NCAR HPC community to share their work and experiences with the group. These talks are a great way to learn about the work of your colleagues and to get feedback on your own work.
  
* **Featured Topics:** We invite experts to present on a variety of topics related to HPC, including software, tools, and best practices. These talks are a great way to learn about new tools and techniques that can help you get the most out of NCAR HPC systems.

* **Round Table:** We close every meeting with an open discussion where you can ask questions, share your experiences, and get feedback from the community.
