Additional quality of life features like GUI file transfers, a terminal window, and local or remote Jupyter notebook execution make VSCode an appealing editor for use with NCAR systems.</p>", "image": null, "date_published": "2024-03-04T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "neumanbrett"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://NCAR.github.io/NHUG/blog/unique-bash-history-on-different-hpc-resources/", "url": "https://NCAR.github.io/NHUG/blog/unique-bash-history-on-different-hpc-resources/", "title": "Unique bash history on different HPC resources", "content_html": "<h1>Unique <code>bash</code> <code>history</code> on different HPC resources</h1>\n<p>NCAR's HPC resource share a common home files system, which greatly simplifies working across systems.

While the commands I usually run on <em>Casper</em> and <em>Derecho</em> are very similar, they are not identical.  Fortunately, <code>bash</code> allows its <code>history</code> behavior to be customized easily, and with just a little effort we can get HPC resource-specific <code>history</code> implementations.</p>", "image": null, "date_published": "2024-01-16T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "benkirk"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://NCAR.github.io/NHUG/blog/streamlining-two-factor-authentication-with-ssh/", "url": "https://NCAR.github.io/NHUG/blog/streamlining-two-factor-authentication-with-ssh/", "title": "Streamlining two-factor authentication with ssh", "content_html": "<h1>Streamlining two-factor authentication with <code>ssh</code></h1>\n<p>Do you tire of responding to Duo pushes every single time you log in to NCAR's HPC resources?
