While two-factor authentication (2FA) is a hard requirement for user access, there are techniques for \"sharing\" authentication, allowing multiple <code>ssh</code> or <code>scp</code> processes to reuse a pre-established connection.  This technique uses the <code>ControlPath</code>  and <code>ControlMaster</code> functionality built in to <code>ssh</code> and requires some straightforward local configuration.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2025-03-26T14:59:03+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "benkirk"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://NCAR.github.io/NHUG/blog/unique-bash-history-on-different-hpc-resources/", "url": "https://NCAR.github.io/NHUG/blog/unique-bash-history-on-different-hpc-resources/", "title": "Unique bash history on different HPC resources", "content_html": "<h1>Unique <code>bash</code> <code>history</code> on different HPC resources</h1>\n<p>NCAR's HPC resource share a common home files system, which greatly simplifies working across systems.  One slight annoyance I noted with this setup, however, is a common <code>bash</code> history across all machines.  While the commands I usually run on <em>Casper</em> and <em>Derecho</em> are very similar, they are not identical.  Fortunately, <code>bash</code> allows its <code>history</code> behavior to be customized easily, and with just a little effort we can get HPC resource-specific <code>history</code> implementations.</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2025-03-26T14:59:03+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "benkirk"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "https://NCAR.github.io/NHUG/blog/jupyter-for-vscode/", "url": "https://NCAR.github.io/NHUG/blog/jupyter-for-vscode/", "title": "Jupyter for VSCode", "content_html": "<h1>Using VSCode for Jupyter Notebooks</h1>\n<p>VSCode is an extensible code editing software that can connect to remote systems like Derecho and Casper.
