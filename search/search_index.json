While two-factor authentication (2FA) is a hard requirement for user access, there are techniques for \"sharing\" authentication, allowing multiple <code>ssh</code> or <code>scp</code> processes to reuse a pre-established connection.  This technique uses the <code>ControlPath</code>  and <code>ControlMaster</code> functionality built in to <code>ssh</code> and requires some straightforward local configuration.</p> <p><code>ControlPath</code> and <code>ControlMaster</code> are <code>ssh</code> client options that work together along with an automatically generated socket file, allowing an initial <code>ssh</code> connection to be reused and optionally persist after the initial session has disconnected.

The total difference between these two readings is then stored in PBS after the job ends. As a result, energy data displayed while a job is running is not meaningful but will be correct after the job is finished.</p> <p>To query this energy data about a recently finished job (currently within the last 72 hours) <code>qstat -f -x</code> can be used, for example:</p> <pre><code>matthews@derecho1:~&gt; qstat -f -x 4238938 | grep 'x-ncar.*-energy'\n    resources_used.x-ncar-cpu-energy = 758\n    resources_used.x-ncar-energy = 2527\n    resources_used.x-ncar-gpu0-energy = 0\n    resources_used.x-ncar-gpu1-energy = 0\n    resources_used.x-ncar-gpu2-energy = 0\n    resources_used.x-ncar-gpu3-energy = 0\n    resources_used.x-ncar-memory-energy = 1131\n</code></pre> <p>Each of these fields is in Joules (Watt*Seconds) and covers a period of time from immediately before the job script starts to immediately after it ends. Total energy is provided as \"x-ncar-energy\" and the energy that the system attributed to the CPU, RAM, and individual GPUs are called out separately. Note that these major components do not constitute all of the energy consumed by the node so the total energy will generally be higher than the sum of the components. There also may be a small error introduced due to the delay between when each of these measurements is sampled. If a job spans multiple nodes, each field represents the total energy consumed by that device type across all nodes. For example, a three-node GPU job would report the sum of all GPU-ID 0 devices in the \"x-ncar-gpu0-energy\" field.</p> <p>If the job ran on a node which didn't have GPUs (as above), the GPU energy will be listed as 0 Joules. If the job ran on a shared node (the develop queue), it's not possible to completely isolate the energy consumption of your job from other jobs running on that node. So it's recommended to rerun your job on an exclusive use node before trusting this data.</p> <p>For completed jobs which began after approximately April 2 2024, <code>qhist</code> can instead be used. For example, to see all power metrics for a single job:</p> <pre><code>vanderwb@derecho2:~&gt; qhist -j 4246835 -l\n4246835.desched1\n...\n   Node Eng (J)  = 5787\n   CPU  Eng (J)  = 691\n   RAM  Eng (J)  = 1006\n   GPU0 Eng (J)  = 626\n   GPU1 Eng (J)  = 610\n   GPU2 Eng (J)  = 623\n   GPU3 Eng (J)  = 612\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Using typical <code>qhist</code> flags, you can also show power metrics for all of your jobs for a particular time period. Here, we display jobs from April 20, 2024, sorted by node energy usage:</p> <pre><code>vanderwb@derecho2:~&gt; qhist -p 20240420 -f '{energy-node}' -s energy-node | head -n 6\nJob ID    E-Node(J)\n4190307   6005563096\n4198428   5612065907\n4194550   3745933887\n4199951   3336310504\n4197478   1259626184\n</code></pre> <p>It should also be noted that this data includes only the energy consumed by the compute nodes. Energy consumed by the interconnect, control system, cooling, and storage is not included as it would be very difficult to proportion to individual jobs. In CISL's experiments for the Green500 it was observed that the GPU partition consumes approximately 15% more energy measured at the circuit breaker than would be accounted for by this method. Energy dedicated to storage and generating facility chilled water would be additional to that 15% but it does include the part of the interconnect which is local to the racks in question and some of the control system. Nevertheless, this data should be accurate enough for use in comparisons of workloads on a science throughput per Joule basis.</p> <p>Due to the heterogeneous and shared nature of Casper, this feature is currently only available on Derecho; however, if you would find it useful on Casper, please let us know. </p>"},{"location":"blog/launch-vscode-on-casper-compute-nodes/","title":"qvscode","text":"<p>NCAR CISL Consulting Services Group has added the qvscode script that starts a new VSCode session on a Casper compute node.

Even basic tasks like editing code with Intellisense can flag users for login node abuse.  The current method to connect to a compute node with VSCode requires creating an interactive job with the scheduler, identifying the compute node you are placed on, and then launching a new window to this node that will likely be different with the next job submission.  This script attempts to make requesting a compute node for VSCode easier and incentivize users to quickly move from the login node to a compute node when they are executing code, navigating large file spaces, need an exclusive node, or need additional compute, memory, or GPU capability from within VSCode.</p>"},{"location":"blog/launch-vscode-on-casper-compute-nodes/#procedure","title":"Procedure","text":"<ol> <li>Open VSCode on your local machine</li> <li>In VSCode, connect to a Casper login node using RemoteSSH as described here</li> <li>Once connected to the login node, open up a new terminal window (Ctrl+Shift+`)</li> <li>Load the ncarenv/24.12 using <code>module load ncarenv/24.12</code> in the terminal</li> <li>Call <code>qvscode</code></li> <li>Enter a valid project code and follow the prompts to launch a PBS job</li> <li>A new VSCode window will open and connect to the compute node when your PBS job has started</li> </ol> <p>A new VSCode window will launch on the compute node after user input or reading from the settings file.
